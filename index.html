                    Our meme coin is built on the Ethereum blockchain and follows the ERC-20 standard. 
                    The total supply of tokens is 50 billion, with 20% of the tokens being sold in the 
                    initial coin offering (ICO). The remaining tokens will be allocated to the team,
